# Brief Introduction to Key4hep Tools

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial you need to log in to a machine where the software stack is installed, e.g. `lxplus` at CERN or the `NAF` at DESY.

Then you can simply initialise the complete stack with:

```bash
. /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/setup-paestum.sh
```
You should then see a message similar to:

```
...  Key4HEP release: 2023-10-07
...  Use the following command to reproduce the current environment:
...
        source /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org/key4hep/releases/2023-10-06-paestum/x86_64-centos7-gcc12.2.0-opt/key4hep-stack/2023-10-07-o4thuq/setup.sh
...
...  If you have any issues, comments or requests, open an issue at https://github.com/key4hep/key4hep-spack/issues
```
**Save this command for further reference. You will then get the exact same
software version as used in this tutorial**

## Input file locations

Some of the tutorials will require some (large-ish) input data files. We have
made them available for download, but for easier access they are also on EOS,
resp. on NFS for the NAF. The top-level directories are

- `/eos/project/k/key4hep/www/key4hep/tutorial/`
- `/nfs/dust/ilc/group/ild/key4hep_tutorial/`

## Introduction

Key4hep is the software ecosystem for future (and current) HEP experiments.
In the following we will very briefly describe the main tools at the core of Key4hep.

Key4hep aims at creating a software ecosystem integrating in an optimal way the best software components to provide a ready-to-use full-fledged solution for data processing of HEP experiments (with initial focus on future colliders).
Using tools developed and used in HEP and ensuring interoperability:

Key4hep is used and developed by the community and combines the software stacks of most of the contributing experiments:

iLCSoft is a subset of Key4hep. It has been developed for two decades by the linear collider community and many tools and algorithms will still be needed in Key4hep.

For the linear collider community we are in a transition period where we gradually replace the LCIO EDM with EDM4hep and the Marlin processing framework with Gaudi:

## Some Core Tools in Key4hep

The following core tools will be introduced in this tutorial

The DD4hep geometry toolkit provides detailed detector models with all necessary information for the complete processing chain:

The LCIO event data model has is at the core of iLCSoft and currently still used in Key4hep as data format for the generator as intermediate data format in the Gaudi MarlinWrapper tool in connection with EDM4hep.

Finally Marlin provides the framework to call all existing reconstruction and analysis modules (called processors):
